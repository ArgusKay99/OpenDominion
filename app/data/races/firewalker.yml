description: >-
  <p>The first Firewalker erupted into existence from the smouldering ashes of a greedy scientist that had sought to enrich himself with forbidden alchemical practices, combining chemistry and pyromancy to forge platinum from the earth itself.</p>
  <p>Turning entire networks of caverns into vast furnaces where they live as one flame, Firewalker alchemies enhanced by pyromantic magics are the most productive in the lands, and their populations spread like wildfire wherever they ignite.</p>
