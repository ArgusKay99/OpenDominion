alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>Once thought to be an ancient curse that transformed men into wolves under the light of a full moon, little is understood about the Lycanthropic affliction. But one thing's for certain&#58; once bitten, you'll never be the same again.</p>
  <p>Capable of agonising transformations into half-beast monsters, Lycanthropes are a hardy and fast-growing race, turning their enemies into werewolves and regenerating non-lethal wounds mid-combat.</p>
