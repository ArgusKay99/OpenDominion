        Investigation and Penalty
        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                If we have reason to believe that you are or have been involved in actions which breach any of these rules, your account may be investigated. While your account is being investigated, it may be suspended during which time you will not be able to log in.
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>If sufficient evidence of breach of rules cannot be found, your account will be unsuspended and you may, at our discretion, be given resources as compensation for the time during which your dominion was suspended.</li>
                    <li>If we determine that you have broken the rules, you will receive a penalty. The penalty shall be both adequate and proportionate and is at our sole discretion.</li>
                    <li>A player who gains an advantage due to the improper behavior of another player may be penalized even if it is completely unintentional, but the penalty shall not leave the player worse off than if they took no action.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The following penalties may be used:
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Suspension (temporary): your dominion is suspended and cannot be used for a period of time. You may resume playing once the suspension is lifted.</li>
                    <li>Suspension (permanent): your dominion is suspended for the remainder of the round.</li>
                    <li>Adjustment: you may have resources, military units, land, prestige, spells, and other parts of your dominion adjusted in your dominion if they are found to be obtained through actions which violate the rules.</li>
                    <li>Name change: if your ruler name or dominion name is found to breach the rules, it may be changed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you have been negatively impacted by other players breaching the rules and this can be substantiated during the investigation, you may receive an adequate and proportionate compensation, at our sole discretion.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
