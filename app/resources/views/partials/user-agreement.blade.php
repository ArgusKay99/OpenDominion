            <li>
                Accounts are personal.

        Gameplay
        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Your realm is your team.</li>
            <li>You must always act in the best interest of your realm, except where such action violates any of the other rules.</li>
            <li>
                You must not in any way cooperate with another realm or dominions in other realms, such as Non-Aggression Pacts ("NAP") or alliances.
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>An "alliance" is defined as intentionally cooperating and/or planning actions with a player or players from another realm in any way, including if it benefits both realms.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>You must not in any way intentionally take any action which solely benefits another realm or a dominion in another realm, whether directly or indirectly.</li>
            <li>You must not share information about any dominion with anyone except with players in your own realm.</li>
            <li>You must at all times refrain from using excessive profanity or abusive, offensive language. Banter and smack talk are allowed; just keep it mostly civil.</li>
            <li>You must not use any scripts, bots, automation software, hacks or other means to perform in-game actions with your dominion at any time.</li>
            <li>
                You must not exploit any bugs in the game.
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>A bug is a feature, mechanic, logic, or other part of the game which is not working as intended or not working at all.</li>
                    <li>You are reasonably expected to know how the game works and we will not accept ignorance as an excuse for exploiting a bug.</li>
                    <li>If you find a bug, please report it immediately in Discord or by contacting an administrator.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you are negatively impacted by a bug and cannot be reasonably expected to have known about the bug, you may be compensated appropriately, at our sole discretion.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Investigation and Penalty
        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                If we have reason to believe that you are or have been involved in actions which breach any of these rules, your account may be investigated. While your account is being investigated, it may be suspended during which time you will not be able to log in.
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>If sufficient evidence of breach of rules cannot be found, your account will be unsuspended and you may, at our discretion, be given resources as compensation for the time during which your dominion was suspended.</li>
                    <li>If we determine that you have broken the rules, you will receive a penalty. The penalty shall be both adequate and proportionate and is at our sole discretion.</li>
                    <li>A player who gains an advantage due to the improper behavior of another player may be penalized even if it is completely unintentional, but the penalty shall not leave the player worse off than if they took no action.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The following penalties may be used:
                <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Suspension (temporary): your dominion is suspended and cannot be used for a period of time. You may resume playing once the suspension is lifted.</li>
                    <li>Suspension (permanent): your dominion is suspended for the remainder of the round.</li>
                    <li>Adjustment: you may have resources, military units, land, prestige, spells, and other parts of your dominion adjusted in your dominion if they are found to be obtained through actions which violate the rules.</li>
                    <li>Name change: if your ruler name or dominion name is found to breach the rules, it may be changed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If you have been negatively impacted by other players breaching the rules and this can be substantiated during the investigation, you may receive an adequate and proportionate compensation, at our sole discretion.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
